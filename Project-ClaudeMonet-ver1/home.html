				<p> Claude Monet also known as Oscar-Claude Monet or Claude Oscar Monet 
					(November 14, 1840 – December 5, 1926) was a founder of French impressionist painting, 
					and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of 
					expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape
					painting. The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression,
					Sunrise.Claude Monet was born on November 14, 1840 on the fifth floor of 45 rue Laffitte,
					in the ninth arrondissement of Paris. He was the second son of Claude-Adolphe and Louise
					-Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On May 20, 1841, he was 
					baptized into the local church parish, Notre-Dame-de-Lorette as Oscar-Claude. In 1845, his
					family moved to Le Havre in Normandy. His father wanted him to go into the family grocery 
					store business, but Claude Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer.

				<p  class="label" id="label-3">Early life</p>
				<div  id="text-3-1"> On the first of April 1851, Monet entered the Le Havre secondary school of the arts. He first
					became known locally for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty
					francs. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from Jacques-François Ochard, a
					former student of Jacques-Louis David. On the beaches of Normandy in about 1856/1857 
					he met fellow artist Eugène Boudin who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints.
					Boudin taught Monet "en plein air" (outdoor) techniques for painting. On 28 January 1857
					his mother died. He was 16 years old when he left school, and went to live with his widowed
					childless aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

					At the beginning of May 1883, Monet and his large family 
					rented a house and two acres from a local landowner. 
					The house was situated near the main road between the 
					towns of Vernon and Gasny at Giverny. There was a barn 
					that doubled as a painting studio, orchards and a small garden. 
					The house was close enough to the local schools for the children 
					to attend and the surrounding landscape offered an endless array
					of suitable motifs for Monet's work. The family worked and built
					up the gardens and Monet's fortunes began to change for the 
					better as his dealer Paul Durand-Ruel had increasing success 
					in selling his paintings. By November 1890 Monet was prosperous
					enough to buy the house, the surrounding buildings and the land
					for his gardens. Within a few years by 1899 Monet built a
					greenhouse and a second studio, a spacious building, well 
					lit with skylights. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, 
					through the end of his life in 1926, Monet worked on "series"
					paintings, in which a subject was depicted in varying light
					and weather conditions. His first series exhibited as such 
					was of Haystacks, painted from different points of view and
					at different times of the day. During World War I, in
					which his younger son Michel served and his friend and
					admirer Clemenceau led the French nation, Monet painted a
					series of Weeping Willow trees as homage to the French 
					fallen soldiers. Cataracts formed on Monet's eyes, for which
				    he underwent two operations in 1923. The paintings done while
					the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone,
					which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. 
					It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain 
					ultraviolet wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by
					the lens of the eye, this may have had an effect on the colors
					he perceived. After his operations he even repainted some of
					these paintings, with bluer water lilies than before the operation.

				<p  class="label" id="label-5">The Life Of Claude Monet</p>
				<div id="text-5-1">Paul Priestley created this documentary film of the 
				Life of Claude Monet (35 minutes in length) for use in schools, 
				art societies and art groups and it is suitable for children from
				around the age of 7 or 8 years old upwards. The film covers 
				all aspects of the famous artist Claude Monet's life, from 
				his initial struggles to get to art school in Paris and earn his 
				father's good wishes, to the birth of Impressionism and his crowning 
				success of his final years painting his waterlily paintings at Giverny. 
				The film also looks at his relationship with his dealers, especially Paul 
				Durand Ruel and his struggle to sell enough paintings to support his children. 
				A number of his paintings, including his Haystack and his Japanese bridge 
				pictures are discussed and his later years spent developing his garden and 
				lake at Giverny which would provide the inspiration for his water lily paintings. 
				Many elements in the film are shot in France in the places in which the artist 
				Monet himself painted. Please note that some aspects of the Life of Claude Monet 
				and the events in it, may have been simplified or amended to make them suitable 
				for a school audience. This video is a great way for kids, students and other 
				people tho learn about the life of Claude Monet and would be a great introduction 
				to an art lesson on Claude Monet or Impressionist painting in schools and 
				colleges.
